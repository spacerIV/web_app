Usage: pgn-extract [arguments] [file.pgn ...]
-7 -- output only the seven tag roster for each game. Other tags (apart
      from FEN and possibly ECO) are discarded (See -e).
-#num -- output num games per file, to files named 1.pgn, 2.pgn, etc.

-aoutputfile -- append extracted games to outputfile. (See -o).
-Aargsfile -- read the program's arguments from argsfile.
-b[elu]num -- restricted bounds on the number of moves in a game.
       lnum set a lower bound of `num' moves,
       unum set an upper bound of `num' moves,
       otherwise num (or enum) means equal-to `num' moves.
-cfile[.pgn] -- Use file.pgn as a check-file for duplicates or
      contents of file (no pgn suffix) as a list of check-file names.
-C -- don't include comments in the output. Ordinarily these are retained.
-dduplicates -- write duplicate games to the file duplicates.
-D -- don't output duplicate games.
-eECO_file -- perform ECO classification of games. The optional
      ECO_file should contain a PGN format list of ECO lines
      Default is to use eco.pgn from the current directory.
-E[123 etc.] -- split output into separate files according to ECO.
      E1 : Produce files from ECO letter, A.pgn, B.pgn, ...
      E2 : Produce files from ECO letter and first digit, A0.pgn, ...
      E3 : Produce files from full ECO code, A00.pgn, A01.pgn, ...
      Further digits may be used to produce non-standard further
      refined division of games.
      All files are opened in append mode.
-F -- output a FEN string comment of the final game position.
-ffile_list  -- file_list contains the list of PGN source files, one per line.
-h -- print details of the arguments.
-llogfile  -- Save the diagnostics in logfile rather than using stderr.
-Llogfile  -- Append all diagnostics to logfile, rather than overwriting.
-M -- Match only games which end in checkmate.
-noutputfile -- Write all valid games not otherwise output to outputfile.
-N -- don't include NAGs in the output. Ordinarily these are retained.
-ooutputfile -- write extracted games to outputfile (existing contents lost).
-P -- don't match permutations of the textual variations (-v).
-Rtagorder -- Use the tag ordering specified in the file tagorder.
-r -- report any errors but don't extract.
-S -- Use a simple soundex algorithm for some tag matches. If used
      this option must precede the -t or -T options.
-s -- silent mode: don't report each game as it is extracted.
-ttagfile -- file of player, date, result or FEN extraction criteria.
-Tcriterion -- player, date, or result extraction criterion.
-U -- don't output games that only occur once. (See -d).
-vvariations -- the file variations contains the textual lines of interest.
-V -- don't include variations in the output. Ordinarily these are retained.
-wwidth -- set width as an approximate line width for output.
-W[cm|epd|halg|lalg|elalg|san] -- specify the output format to use.
      Default is SAN.
      -W means use the input format.
      -Wcm is (a possibly obsolete) ChessMaster format.
      -Wepd is EPD format.
      -Wjson is JSON format.
      -Wejson is extended JSON format (with each move's FEN).
      -Wsan[PNBRQK] for language specific output.
      -Whalg is hyphenated long algebraic.
      -Wlalg is long algebraic.
      -Welalg is enhanced long algebraic.
      -Wuci is output compatible with the UCI protocol.
-xvariations -- the file variations contains the lines resulting in
                positions of interest.
-zendings -- the file endings contains the end positions of interest.
-Z -- use the file virtual.tmp as an external hash table for duplicates.
      Use when MallocOrDie messages occur with big datasets.
