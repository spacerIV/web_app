=head1 NAME

Chess::PGN::Extract - Parse PGN files by using `pgn-extract`

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Chess::PGN::Extract;

    # Slurp all games in a PGN file
    my @games = read_games ("filename.pgn");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Chess::PGN::Extract> provides a function to extract chess records from
Portable Game Notation (PGN) files.

B<Chess::PGN::Extract> internally depends on
L<JSON-enhanced pgn-extract|https://bitbucket.org/mnacamura/pgn-extract>,
a command line tool to manipulate PGN files. So, please put the C<pgn-extract>
in your C<PATH> for using this module.

If you want to deal with a huge PGN file with which slurping is expensive,
consider to use L<Chess::PGN::Extract::Stream>, which provides a file stream
class to read games iteratively.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over

=item B<read_games ($pgn_file)>

Read all games contained in the C<$pgn_file> at once and return an C<ARRAY> of
them.

Perl expression of one game will be something like this:

  { Event     => "LAPUTA: Castle in the Sky",
    Site      => "Tiger Moth",
    Date      => "1986.08.02",
    Round     => 1,
    White     => "Captain Dola",
    Black     => "Jicchan",
    Result    => "1-0",
    Moves     => ["e2-e4", "g7-g6"],
  }

B<NOTE>

In a typical PGN file, moves are recorded in standard algebraic notation
(SAN):

   1. e4 g6
   ...

C<pgn-extract> converts it to long algebraic notation (LAN), and so does this
module:

   my ($game) = read_games ($pgn_file);
   $game->{Moves} #=> ["e2-e4", "g7-g6", ...]

For details about PGN, SAN, and LAN, see, I<e.g.>,
L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation> and
L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_notation>.
